# Final-Year-Project---Personalized-Route-Recommendation-System

Track of various things related to my final year project, it's progress and the actual implementation

### Motivation

With rapid increase in tourism activities and advancements in public transportation , the route recommendation system has evolved into an important service that assists in commuting and travel planning. However, the quality of most existing and popular recommendation systems leave a lot of room for improvement, with research demonstrating that the user's preferred path is very different from the advised route.
A traveler's route preferences between a given origin and a destination are influenced by a variety of circumstances. As a result, determining the ideal path is very subjective and difficult to compute properly based on predetermined criteria. This highlights the need of including unique human behavior and user-specific attention in such systems.

## Problem Statement

The main objective of the study is identifying effective recommendation techniques and methodologies before constructing a model that can recommend personalized routes to the user. This will overcome the shortcomings of previous methods and present an alternative approach towards route recommendation. Other functions that improve the overall travel experience will also be included.
